Now the battery will no longer hold a charge at all.  Which is incredibly sad when you are paying so much for a product that works really well.  Honestly this company can't spend a few more cents for a decent battery that will hold up?  My induction rechargeable toothbrush has a better set up; it has lasted for 6 years and is still going strong.  Come on Clarisonic - I am not the only one who has brought this topic up.  There is an entire group of YouTube videos dedicated to detailing how to break into your products in the complicated process solely to swap out the cheap battery for a low cost - high quality battery.\nTreat your customers with a little more respect.\n===========================================\n\nMy wife likes to call this her \"little genie\".  The bristles are gentle on the skin, yet provide a thorough, deep pore cleansing.  The rotating head vibrates enough to be effecting, but not so fast that it feels like a grinding wheel and the entire package is easy to hold in your palm.  Great for control and being easy to reach all the areas of your face. The motor is powerful and does not get bogged down and the charge lasts a really long time. It has two speeds - one for extra gentle - but she rarely uses this speed.  Plus the entire package is waterproof.  To charge, just rest it in the cradle charger provided.\n\nMy wife like to use her preferred cleanser (not a bar of soap). Her recommendation is to keep the brush head clean and dry when not in use.  In other words, don't use it, put it down and just walk away.  Keep the head clean and make sure it dries really well between use.  She sets hers bristle down on a folded sheet of paper towel.  As others have stated, soak it in hydrogen peroxide every few weeks.\n\nKind of pricey, but well made and certainly worth it.\n\nCheers!"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-06-30T01:34:30.306011Z","updated_at":"2022-06-30T01:54:29.527262Z","project":3},{"id":7201,"annotations":[{"id":207,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"data-43508","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"prediction"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-06-30T01:54:17.088287Z","updated_at":"2022-06-30T01:54:17.088314Z","lead_time":4.734,"prediction":{"id":7201,"model_version":"undefined","created_ago":"19 minutes","result":[{"value":{"choices":["Negative"]},"id":"data-43508","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices"}],"score":null,"cluster":null,"neighbors":null,"mislabeling":0.0,"created_at":"2022-06-30T01:34:30.780663Z","updated_at":"2022-06-30T01:34:30.780673Z","task":7201},"result_count":0,"task":7201,"parent_prediction":7201,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"0a27c3a5-pre-annotations.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[7201],"data":{"text":"Good product, just arrived with sticky substance all over the lid."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2022-06-30T01:34:30.305971Z","updated_at":"2022-06-30T01:54:17.105823Z","project":3},{"id":7200,"annotations":[{"id":206,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"data-22375","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"prediction"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2022-06-30T01:54:12.010766Z","updated_at":"2022-06-30T01:54:12.010789Z","lead_time":1.35,"prediction":{"id":7200,"model_version":"undefined","created_ago":"19 minutes","result":[{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"data-22375","from_name":"sentiment","to_name":"text","type":"choices"}],"score":null,"cluster":null,"neighbors":null,"mislabeling":0.0,"created_at":"2022-06-30T01:34:30.780625Z","updated_at":"2022-06-30T01:34:30.780635Z","task":7200},"result_count":0,"task":7200,"parent_prediction":7200,"parent_annotation":null}],"file_upload":"0a27c3a5-pre-annotations.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[7200],"data":{"text":"This older model runs off batteries which need to be replaced frequently.
